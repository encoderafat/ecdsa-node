## ECDSA Node

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. Since there is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. We won't worry about distributed consensus for this project.

However, something that we would like to incoporate is Public Key Cryptography. By using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.

This is a very simplified solution as it only ensures that the signing wallet is the same as the wallet that is transferring amount. It is done by ensuring that
the signing wallet signs a transcation that is then send to the server along with the amount, message hash, public addresses of the sender and receiving wallets. The server uses the verify function of the ethereum cryptography's secp256k1 library to verify that the signer wallet is same as the sender wallet. So, for example, wallet 1 can only transfer amount from wallet 1 to wallet 3. If it tries to transfer any amount from wallet 2 to wallet 3, the server will make sure that since the signed transaction didn't come  from wallet 2 , it will fail.

### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies 
3. Run `node index` to start the server 

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically! 

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.
